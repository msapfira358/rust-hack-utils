# 🚀 Rust Cheat Engine: Ultimate Memory Hacking Toolkit �  

Welcome to the **Rust Cheat Engine** repository! 🔥 This powerful toolkit is designed for memory hacking, game manipulation, and reverse engineering, all built with the blazing-fast **Rust** programming language. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, this project provides the tools and libraries needed to analyze and modify memory in real-time.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Memory Scanning** 🕵️‍♂️: Quickly locate and modify values in a process's memory.  
- **Pattern Recognition** 🧩: Identify complex byte patterns for dynamic addresses.  
- **Cross-Platform** 💻: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (with some limitations).  
- **Safe & Efficient** 🛡️: Leverages Rust's safety guarantees for stable and secure memory operations.  
- **Extensible** 🔧: Easily integrate with other tools or scripting languages.
